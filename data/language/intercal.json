      "name": " INTERCAL",
      "def": " INTERCAL is a parody computer language designed in the early 1970s. It was meant to make fun of the tendencies for programming languages to be overly technical and difficult to understand. But it's still a real language that you can download and maybe even get to do things for you. This is assuming you are nice enough - but not too nice, because INTERCAL doesn't like that either.",
